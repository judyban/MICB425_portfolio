### Portfolio repo setup
Detail the code you used to create, initialize, and push your portfolio repo to GitHub. This will be helpful as you will need to repeat many of these steps to update your porfolio throughout the course.

starting from after registering for a new GitHub account  
1. git init  
2. git add .  
3. git commit -m "First commit"  
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/judyban/MICB425_portfolio  
5. git remote -v  
6. git push -u origin master  

Repeat steps 2, 3 and git push to push new materials into the repository  


### RMarkdown pretty html challenge

The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we’ve shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won’t feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We’re here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.

####Challenge Goals

The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It’s a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)

**hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](http://phdcomics.com/) to see if you can find the image above**  
*If you can’t find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown*

#####Here's a header!

Let’s be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents).

######Another header, now with maths

Perhaps you’re already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you’re so confused that you’ve forgotton how to add. Never fear!
~~A calculator~~
R is here:

```{r}
1231521+12341556280987
```

####Table Time

Or maybe, after you’ve added those numbers, you feel like it’s about time for a table!
I’m going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It’s not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")
```

And now you’ve almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we’re so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here’s ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!

## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence worksheet 01 
The template for the first Evidence Worksheet has been included here. The first thing for any assignment should link(s) to any relevant literature (which should be included as full citations in a module references section below).

You can copy-paste in the answers you recorded when working through the evidence worksheet into this portfolio template. 

As you include Evidence worksheets and Problem sets in the future, ensure that you delineate Questions/Learning Objectives/etc. by using headers that are 4th level and greater. This will still create header markings when you render (knit) the document, but will exclude these levels from the Table of Contents. That's a good thing. You don't' want to clutter the Table of Contents too much.

[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  
1.what is the estimated abundance of prokaryotes in various reservoirs on Earth?  
2.what is the estimated abundance of the primary nutrients content of prokaryotes in reservoirs?

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  
Pooled data from literature, extrapolation from averages of various characteristics of
prokaryotes such as volume and density, and from environments such as porosity.  
Carbon content were found from average content of carbon produced per prokaryote.  

* Summarize the main results or findings.  
Earth's prokaryotes contain 10-fold more nutrients than plants and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. The total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60-100% of the estimated total carbon in plants. The largest reservoir of prok are the ocean, soil, oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, and the ocean had the largest turnover of prokaryotes. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes can introduce mutations that leads to large capacity for genetic diversity.  

* Do new questions arise from the results?  
Current data has a lot of uncertainty with the methods, used, such as in the estimate of prokaryotes abndance in groundwater.  
There were also questions arised from these uncertainties, such as how does prokaryotic turnover affect the nutrient cycles? The genetic diveresity in prokaryotes is vast and there has been limiting understanding, the authors also is uncertain about how all the metabolic pathways of microbes can fit into the currently existing nutrient cycles.  

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  
Challenges:  
the authors did not provide enough background on prokaryote abundance on Earth to
readers who lack the background, but rather jumped into the numbers.  
Minimal explanation of their calculation and methods.  
Assumptions:  
The authors were aware of the extrapolation of data from literature, but lacked
criticism against the validity of values from these literatures.  
The authors were also aware areas of conflict in data presented from different
literatures.  
Conclusions:  
The results were impactful, there was evidence presented from a variety of primary
literature to support the conclusion.  
The figures and tables were straightforward and easy to understand.  


### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.    

Primary Habitats | Total Cell Abundance
---------------- | --------------
Open ocean       |   1.2 x 10^29
Soil             |   2.6 x 10^29  
Subsurface       |   3.8 x 10^30
Oceanic subsurface|   3.5 x 10^30
Terrestrial subsurface|   0.25 x 10^30-2.3 x 10^30

* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including *Prochlorococcus*? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  


The estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean is 3.6 x 1028, cell density is 5 x 105 CFUs/mL. Cyanobacteria has density of 4 x 104 cells/ml. 8% of total prokaryotic cell abundance is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Procholorococcus.  Since they are autotrophs, they are the major players in driving one part of the carbon cycle by assimilating inorganic carbon into organic carbon through photosynthesis. They also drive the food web by being at the bottom of it and serving as primary producers.  

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  

Autotroph – “self-nourishing” -- uses inorganic carbon to produce complex organic carbon as a source of carbon for other organotrophs (fixing CO2 into biomass).  

Heterotroph – uses organic carbon assimilated by autotrophs as sources of carbon. Assimilate organic carbon.   

Lithotroph –  technically obtains electron sources from inorganic chemicals, they can use material other than inorganic carbon to obtain reducing agents. Use inorganic substrates.  


* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  


The deepest habitat is oceanic subsurface that goes below ground up to 4 km. At increasing depth, high temperature of 125C, becomes a primary limiting factor to prokaryotic life. Change in temperature is about an increase of 22C/km.


* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  
The highest place prokaryotes can be found is 77km, but most bacteria found up there were transferred there instead of native inhabitants. Realistic habitats is around 20km. I predict that most of them would be spore-forming bacteria.   
While the paper did not provide a clear answer to the limiting factor, a thinning of atmospheric gasses at high altitudes limits the abundance of nutrients that can be provided for prokaryote uptake. There is also a lack of moisture in the upper atmosphere that could lead to desiccation. UV is also strong.  


* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?  
20km (atmospheric) + 4km (subsurface) = 24km  


* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)  
(Population size) x (# of turnovers/year) = cells/year  
Example Marine heterotrophs:  
3.6 x 10^28 cells x (365 days per year/16 turnovers) = 8.2 x 10^29 cells/year



* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  
The estimate of prokaryotic carbon in the upper 200m of ocean environment sets limits for the turnover rates in these population. In turn, the turn over rate can be determined based the carbon assimilation efficiency necessary for the carbon estimated content in the environment. This value varies with depth and different habitats because different environments support unique community of prokaryotes that have varying productivity and carbon assimilation efficiency, which  results in different turnover rates.  



* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  
(4x10^(-7))^4 x 8.2x10^29 = 2.1x10^4 mutations/year

* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  
Large population size and high mutation rate can be considered a major source of genetic diversity and one of the essential factors that allows prokaryotes to first adapt , then evolve in different environments. While point mutations are common, they are not the only way to adapt. Other methods include horizontal transfer of genetic material between different prokaryotes.


* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?  
Prokaryote abundance creates an opportunity for frequent mutations and genetic material exchanges that allows adaptation of prokaryotes to different habitats. Adaptation to unique environments will eventually lead to divergence in metabolic potential and ultimately evolution and diversity.

### Problem set_02 Microbial Enginess  

[Falkowski *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18497287)  


#### Learning objectives: 
Discuss the role of microbial diversity and formation of coupled metabolism in driving global biogeochemical cycles.

#### Specific Questions:
* What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?  
Geophysical processes are tectonics and atmospheric photochemical processes continuously supply substrates and remove products to create geochemical cycles. Majority of abioitic geochemical reactions based on acid/base chemistry. Biogeochemical reactions are based on redox reactions. The biological fluxes of H, C, N, O, S are largely catalyzed by microbes with redox reactions.  
The six major elements of life are H, C, N, O, S and P. The biological fluxes of H, C, N, O, S are largely catalyzed by microbes with redox reactions, while geological supply of C, S and P is dependent on tectonics, such as volcanism and rock weathering. Abiotic processes are mostly driven by acid/base reactions and biotic processes by redox reactions. In particular for Earth, the biological oxidation is driven by photosynthesis.  


* Why is Earth's redox state considered an emergent property?  
The biotic and abiotic processes altered the surface redox state of the planets. It is the feedbacks between the metabolic and geological processes that create the average redox condition of the oceans and atmosphere.   
  

* How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?  
On a community scale such as methanogens, the redox process requires cooperation of multiple species. For example, methane is reduced from CO2 and H2 by methanogenic Archaea. Hydrogen-consuming sulfate reducers present in vicinity will reduce [hydrogen] and causes the reverse process to become thermodynamically favorable. The methane can then be oxidized by other species to release H2.  
Whereas in a microbiological scale inside the cell, some cycles can be reversible, like the TCA. Some archaea can use TCA to both oxidize organic carbon into CO2 to release energy and also assimilate CO2 into organic matter by using energy. The energy produced from oxidation process can feed into the reductive process.  


* Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox niches and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2LMNfSh.png)

* What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?  
usually metabolic pathways evolved to use substrates that are the end products of other types of microbial metabolism, suchc as heterotrophs using the organic carbon byproducts of photosynthesis. Early cellular evolution included horizontal gene transfer as the principle mode of evolution. The genes responsible for major metabolic processes or entire metabolic pathways have probably been distributedin a common gene pool before further differentiation of species. Afterwards, nutritional and bioenergetic selective pressures drive the retention of these horizontally transferred genes. 

* On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?  
microbes can maintain genes for metabolism through HGT. Even if one community becomes extinct, the wide-spread distribution of these genes across many communities and niches will allow the metabolic pathways to be preserved.
